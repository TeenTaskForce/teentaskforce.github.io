We are Team 2, and today I am going to tell you guys what we did on the first day of class! On the first day of class, we learned a lot of new things! In the morning, we started Web Development with Kevin. It was really fun as we transfered from the fundamentals, to coding in HTML. We wrote our own code, and I was impressed about how much I could learn in one day! Furthermore, we gradually started our next topic, python! We did python with Sid, and it was really interesting! We started off with learning how to code in Anaconda, and Jupyter. I learned a lot of new coding techniques, which was awesome!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we ended the morning with lunch just outside the building. After that, we got right into Graphics Design! Now this part was my favorite! We learned about how colors need to contrast, and we learned about the body and header fonts and design. We opened up PhotoShop, and did some fun activities! After that, we played a game where we had to do a certain amount of jumping jacks, and find the difference between the numbers! To me is was like a little fun exercise before we sat back down for our next topic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, we moved on to business. In business, we got to know our teams, and we discussed about what business was, and what was the point of making a business, and what you need to create a business. This part of the day was great! After that, the clock struck 5:00, and it was time to go. I had a great day and couldn&rsquo;t wait for another!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c6">What did I learn that day?</span></p><p class="c0 c13"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That day, I learned a lot of new things. Let me begin my long list now. I learned how to code in HTML, code in python, create my own website, how people attract buyers to their products with color and contrast(Graphic Design), and how to create my own business. All the things I learned really boosted up my knowledge. I can&rsquo;t wait to learn more!</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c13"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c6">What did I find difficult?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">That day, I learned a lot of things, and most of those things I found quite hard or difficult. For starters like me, learning things is easy, but becoming a master at it is pretty challenging. For example, I found the HTML coding &nbsp;quite difficult for me. I didn&rsquo;t understand much, but I caught a few things on the way. I also had a bit difficulty with Anaconda. I was easy at first, but it got harder on the way. It really challenged me, but that is what I like. Other than that, I understood everything else really well!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c11"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c6">What did I like to do that day?</span></p><p class="c0 c13"><span class="c5">That day, so many fun things were going on I really didn&rsquo;t know what I really enjoyed the most. They were all really great, but I actually think that the best part of my day was the Graphics Design. I really learned a lot about color, presentation, contrast, and how to catch the person&#39;s eye, that they have to read it. This was really fun, and it was the best part of my day!</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c13"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c13"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c13"><span class="c5">Link to Prezi Presentation on Graphic Design: </span></p><p class="c0 c13"><span class="c5">https://prezi.com/bnoayv5y-7er/edit/#0_0091823</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c13"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c13"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c13"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c13"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday: July 30, 2016</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Blog Post #2</span></p><p class="c0 c12 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9">A Guide to Day 5 at Startup Academy</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c11"><span class="c18"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">Hello everyone! This is Startup Academy&rsquo;s Team 2: Saanvi Mantripragada, Shaunak Panda, Lipika Chatur, Narahari Rao, Anvee Bhutani, and Ria Nawathe. We are also the founders of our startup, Teen Task Force. Welcome to our second blog post on Day 5 of Startup Academy. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">We started off the day by watching a video of Steve Jobs giving a commencement speech at Stanford in 2005. This gave us insight on the story behind the man who created one of the greatest tech companies in the world today and what it takes to create a startup. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">Next, our team gathered together to discuss the website layout for Teen Task Force, research solutions to potential liability issues as well as expanding our user base, and present a practice pitch to our instructors. After the practice pitch, the instructors asked us questions and tried to poke holes in our business so that we could find potential problems and then come up with ways to solve them.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">We moved on to learning more of the basic skills we will need to ultimately launch our business. We started learning how to work with Git, a version control system, and created a local repository on each one of our computers so that we could simultaneously work on our website code and push it to each other after making changes. We worked and experimented with Git until lunch time.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">After lunch, we started Python programming. We learned how to store data or information into a table using lists and the pd.read_csv command. This helps organize data and make different parts of it easily accessible, which is needed for data analytics.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">We took a quick break after this and played a charades type game.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">Then, we went to web development and what elements together make an attractive, eye-catching, and successful flyer that will be a good marketing tool. We were shown different flyers and asked to identify what we found eye-catching/not eye-catching about it and if it was a well-designed flyer.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">Lastly, we learned about the different types of businesses, such as sole proprietorship, corporation, partnership, etc. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">One thing that was somewhat difficult was making sure we had the proper syntax in our code while working with Python programming. Another thing that was difficult was trying to find all possible problems that could occur with our business idea and attempting to find a viable solution. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">Everything was somewhat enjoyable because we learned many new things and expanded our knowledge in various subjects.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">That&rsquo;s all for Day 5 of Startup Academy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c11 c4"><span class="c9">Tutorial: How To Make An Attractive Flyer</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c11 c4"><span class="c9"></span></p><ol class="c15 lst-kix_89om0g2h1ppf-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c2">First, choose a template that will suit the product/service/event you are advertising and fit all needed information.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c2">Choose a color palette that fits the mood and style of what is being advertised.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c2">Create a big, bold, eye-catching header that will attract the reader&rsquo;s attention right away. The font should be unique and fancy but also legible. Note that the color of the text should fit the color palette and complement the rest of the flyer while still being the most striking part.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c2">List your text in strategic places based on the order of their importance. Also, the text that is more important should have a bigger font.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c2">Also make sure that the text is concise so the reader does not get bored reading it.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c2">To facilitate this for the reader, create designs and such that will act like visual &ldquo;arrows&rdquo; and point the reader to what they should read next.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c2">For the text, use a font that is easily readable.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c2">Adding a few visual aids, such as images, might also add to the flyer but make sure not to overdo it and add too many elements to the flyer. This might confuse the reader and he or she will not know where to focus. They will not feel like reading it.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c2">Finally, make sure every element is laid out properly. Make sure that all the colors are complementary and don&rsquo;t distract from the main header. Make sure that the text is legible and has all the needed information. Make sure that the flyer is visually pleasing and will attract people, not drive them away.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c2">You now have an attractive flyer! Congratulations!</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">8/2/16</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Blog Post #3</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c6">Day 6 at Startup Academy!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Hey everyone! This is team 2, and today we are going to guide you through our day 6 at startup academy! We started our day with business, which was really fun and interesting. Harshita taught this subject, and during business, we talked about how you want to present during the pitch. To be prepared for this, she gave us a random topic, like paper, and we had to present it in front of the class. By doing this, we judged each other what we did and did not do while speaking. This was really fun!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we gradually transferred into Python with Sid. During this session, we started the first part of our data analysis for our surveys, by organizing all the responses in a table. This helped our team proceed in our project. A while later, we took a break for lunch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunch, we transferred into Graphics Design with Brittney. In the beginning, we took a logo quiz which was very fun. We had to identify the logo by only seeing a small portion of it. To continue, we talked about what we needed to have on our flyers, and how to design them. From there, we got some time to design our flyers and logos. During this time, we also took the time to complete our flyers, finish our biographies about ourselves, edit the website, and complete all three blogs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we ended our day with Web Development. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">All in all, Day 6 was really fun!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did I learn that day? That day, I learned more about making a flyer, and how to pitch in front of a large audience. Everything else that we did that day was either review , or time to work on our project. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did I find difficult? I wouldn&rsquo;t say difficult, but the hardest thing that today was speaking in front of the class. That doesn&rsquo;t sound so hard, but the trick was, that we were only given 20 seconds to think of a pitch about a random topic given by our mentor. We then had to give a one minute speech about our topic while incorporating what we learned from our mentor. It was hard at first, but when I finished, I felt relieved!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did I like to do that day? That day, I enjoyed business the most, because it was fun and interesting. We learned how to speak in front of the judges and a huge audience! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c11 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c11 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c11 c4"><span class="c9">Tips For a Successful Pitch Presentation</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c11 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><ol class="c15 lst-kix_p7e3atin8by-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c5">First of all, your pitch should be straightforward and concise as well as engaging and relatable.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c5">As soon as you meet your judges or whoever you are presenting your pitch to, shake their hands and manifest yourself as a confident, respectful person. Create a good impression of yourself in front of the judges and start off on a good note.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c5">When you start your speech, start strongly and confidently. Show that you are passionate through your facial expressions.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c5">Maybe tell the judges an anecdote to engage them and get them interested in your pitch.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c5">Establish that you are knowledgeable in the subject you are speaking about.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c5">Project well, but don&rsquo;t shout. Enunciate your words and present clearly. Speak with inflection and enthusiasm.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c5">Speak naturally, but also be prepared on your topic. Note: Don&rsquo;t use filler words such as &ldquo;um&rdquo; and &ldquo;uh&rdquo; or blabber randomly if you don&rsquo;t know what to say next.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c5">Pace yourself when speaking; don&rsquo;t speak too fast or too slowly. Make sure everyone has time to process and understand what you are saying.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c5">Keep a good posture and stand with poise. Use hand gestures to add to your speech.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c5">Use the stage to your advantage! Move around a little. You don&rsquo;t have to stay stuck in the same place.</span></li><li class="c0 c8"><span class="c5">Lastly, but most importantly, don&rsquo;t forget to HAVE FUN!</span></li></ol><p class="c10 c1"><span class="c17"></span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c14"></span></p><p class="c0 c1 c13"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c20"><span class="c5"></span></p></body></html>
